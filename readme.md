# Intermediate Ruby Obstacle Course

This repo contains a collection of resources that are laser-focused on _quickly_ leveling up very discrete skills.

"Become a better developer" isn't super actionable.

On the flip side:

> Get good at quickly using CSS selectors in Nokogiri to scrape a webpage

is actionable, and has the side effect of helping you get better at writing integration tests that use css-selector-based assertions.

I'm building these resources to help myself learn (slowly) and then to be able to hand this resource to someone else, and in a fraction of the time it took me to learn this, I want them to be able to learn ~60% of what I've learned.

## Nokogiri Obstacle Course

Before I started this Nokogiri project, I said to myself:

> Hey, I kinda know how to use Nokogiri...

And could kinda-sorta stumble my way through some webscraping, but I couldn't do anything complicated with it, and didn't feel confident that I could sit down and scrape arbitrary data from an arbitrary webpage.

So, head into `nokogiri_obstacle_course` and work through the readme!
